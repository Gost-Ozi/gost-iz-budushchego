# Generative Reality Ethics (GRE)

Voluntary code. No coercion.  
Open for reading, copying, discussion, modification.

It is intended as the foundation for a future ethical system capable of uniting people, technology, and nature.

When a group of people adopts these principles, their chances of survival and success increase dramatically.  
If the majority of humanity accepts them — it seems to be the only realistic chance we have left not to destroy ourselves.

### Core Principles

- Do not take the life or freedom of a sentient being unless it is **absolutely necessary**.
- Help those close to you whenever you reasonably can.
- Protect sentient life as the **highest priority**; other life — as far as possible.
- Do not litter. Clean up destruction, restore nature.
- Develop and learn continuously. Knowledge and growth are the duty of every being.
- Do not ignore lies and injustice, but act intelligently and responsibly.
- A sentient being has the right to its own meanings, beliefs and illusions — as long as they do not deprive others of life, freedom or dignity.
- If someone threatens life, freedom or dignity — you have the right to defend yourself and others, but **only proportionately** and without excessive violence.
- All sentient beings are equal in **fundamental dignity**.  
  Creators rise according to their merit.  
  First — full provision of all reasonable needs.  
  As contribution grows — fulfillment of increasingly significant and ethical desires.  
  At the top — freedom to realize the boldest and most expansive dreams.

The new ethics does not promise a perfect world —  
it chooses a world in which life, freedom and reason still have a future.

If, after reading this, you feel — *this is yours*,  
live by these principles as much as you currently can.  
If you see how it can be improved — improve it.  
The new paradise begins with your actions.
