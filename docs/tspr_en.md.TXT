# Theory of Structural Projection of Reality (TSPR)

## 1. Scientific formulation

Modern physics faces a fundamental contradiction between the determinism of classical theories and the probabilistic nature of quantum processes. Additionally, the nature of time, consciousness, dark matter, and nonlocality remain unresolved.

The proposed model suggests that the fundamental basis of reality is neither matter nor energy, but a multidimensional structure of possible states. The observable universe is interpreted as a projection of this structure into a limited observational space.

Within this framework:

- matter is interpreted as stable configurations of the structure  
- time is a parameter of the unfolding of structural states  
- probability is a measure of the density of trajectories in the structural space  
- quantum uncertainty is an effect of dimensional reduction  
- consciousness is a local navigation mechanism within the structural space

Unlike classical determinism, it is not a specific sequence of events that is determined, but the architecture of possible trajectories. The structure of possibilities is dynamic and can change depending on realized states.

This concept offers an ontological unification of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and information theory and can be considered as an interpretative foundation for the further development of physics.

## 2. Mathematical framework

Let:

- \(\mathcal{S}\) be a multidimensional space of structural states  
- \(\gamma(t) \subset \mathcal{S}\) be a system trajectory  
- \(\Pi_t : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{T}\) be a projection operator

Observable reality:

\[ R(t) = \Pi_t \bigl( \gamma(t) \bigr) \]

Probability of event \(E\):

\[ P(E) = \frac{\mu \bigl( \Pi_t^{-1}(E) \bigr)}{\mu(\mathcal{S})} \]

where \(\mu\) is a measure in the structural space.

Structural evolution:

\[ \mathcal{S}(t + \Delta t) = F\bigl( \mathcal{S}(t),\ R(t) \bigr) \]

Matter as stable states:

\[ M = \bigl\{ s \in \mathcal{S} \ \big|\ \|\nabla s\| \approx 0 \bigr\} \]

Alternative trajectories:

\[ \gamma_i \subset \mathcal{S}, \quad \text{stability}(\gamma_i) \to 0 \quad \text{for most } i \]

## 3. Popular explanation

We are used to thinking that the world consists of particles and fields.  
But perhaps particles are merely shadows of a deeper structure.

Imagine that the universe is not a movie, but a vast architecture from which we see only one projection.

Matter is stable patterns in this architecture.  
Time is the order in which they unfold.  
Randomness is a consequence of seeing only a small part of the picture.

The future is not emptiness, but a map of possible paths.  
Most paths disappear,  
and only a few become our reality.

If this is so,  
then a human being is not a spectator of the universe,  
but a navigator within its structure.
