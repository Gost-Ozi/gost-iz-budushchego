## Preamble

This document is the **formal core** of the Generative Ethics of Reality (GRE).  
It does not replace the human manifesto but provides it with an **operational foundation**: definitions, invariants, and protocols that can be verified, challenged, and relied upon when building any ethical, legal, or economic systems.

GRE does not require faith. It requires understanding and consent.

## Section 1. Basic Definitions

### 1.1. R — Rational Being
A system belonging to a species recognized as possessing three characteristics:
1. **Reflection** — awareness of oneself as a subject in time.
2. **Goal-setting** — the ability to form preferences and set goals.
3. **Autonomy of choice** — the ability to choose between alternatives.

*Note:* The status of "rational" is assigned to the species as a whole after open verification. Individual exceptions (illness, incapacity, crime) are governed by special protocols outside this core.

### 1.2. D — Basic Dignity
The fundamental value of the existence of any R.
- D(R) ≠ 0 for any R.
- D(R) does not depend on usefulness, strength, intelligence, or other metrics of efficiency.

### 1.3. P — Primordial Protection
The minimum inviolable set that is part of D(R):
- Life.
- Bodily and mental integrity.
- Basic level of freedom of choice.
- Internal autonomy (the right to one's own goals and meanings).

*Note:* P is inalienable and cannot be voluntarily transferred.

### 1.4. F — Freedom
The set of actions of R that do not violate the P of other R:
F(R) = { A | action A does not diminish P(X) for any X ≠ R }

### 1.5. C — Creation
An action that increases the aggregate future potential (Φ):
C = action where ΔΦ > 0

### 1.6. Φ — Future Potential
The total space of possibilities for all existing and future R over time.

It is measured through the **comparative effectiveness of systems**:
- If, after the adoption of a set of laws, the living conditions of R objectively improve (according to agreed metrics) — ΔΦ > 0.
- If they worsen — ΔΦ < 0, the system is recognized as harmful.

### 1.7. E — Harm
An action that diminishes the P of another R without meeting all three conditions of extreme necessity:
1. **Immediacy** — the threat is happening right now.
2. **Inevitability** — there is no other way to avoid the threat.
3. **Proportionality** — the harm caused is less than the harm prevented.

*Note:* Even if the conditions are met, the action remains a crime but is subject to compensation, not eternal condemnation.

## Section 2. Invariants (Laws of Conservation)

**I1. Non-nullification of Dignity**
No action can nullify the D(R) of any R.

**I2. Inviolability of Primordial Protection**
P(R) cannot be violated except under the simultaneous fulfillment of all conditions of extreme necessity.

**I3. Prohibition of Mass Nullification**
Optimization of Φ cannot be achieved through the mass nullification of D of a multitude of R.

**I4. Preservation of the Future**
In the long term, the global change in Φ must be non-negative: ΔΦ(global) ≥ 0.

## Section 3. Gradation of Protection

Protection is determined by two factors:
1. **Value of the species** — contribution to Φ, uniqueness, role in the ecosystem of reason.
2. **Specific case** — individual circumstances, level of threat, possibility of compensation.

Levels of protection:
- **P1 (basic)** — protection from destruction (for all living things).
- **P2 (extended)** — protection of freedom and integrity (for R that have passed verification).
- **P3 (full)** — protection of autonomy and meanings (for R with developed reflection).

## Section 4. Resolving Conflicts of Invariants

### 4.1. Level 1: Situational Action
If delay leads to the irreversible loss of D of a multitude of R or the collapse of Φ, any R has the right to take emergency action, violating invariants to the minimum necessary extent.

*Post-conditions:*
- The action is subject to public verification.
- If the action was not minimally necessary — it qualifies as a grave crime with maximum compensation.
- If the action is recognized as neutral or beneficial — the subject receives an increase in status (coefficient of creation) proportional to the benefit.

### 4.2. Level 2: Collective Decision
If time permits, the conflict is resolved through:
1. Scientific verification of consequences.
2. Open dialogue between all interested parties.
3. Qualified voting (e.g., ⅔ or ¾).

### 4.3. Principle of Residual Responsibility
Any decision that violates invariants creates a debt to the system, to be compensated in the future.

## Section 5. Application and Development

### 5.1. Version 1.0 Status
- Definitions and invariants are fixed.
- First-level open questions are closed.
- The document is ready for testing, discussion, and use as a foundation for applied systems.

### 5.2. How to Work with the Core
- Definitions are axioms. They do not change without a revision of the foundation.
- Any new rule must be derived from the definitions and checked for consistency with the invariants.
- All significant precedents are recorded in an open registry.

### 5.3. How to Check Compatibility with Other Systems
Any external system (law, economics, morality) can be compared with GRE through **formal mapping**:
1. Identify which elements of the external system correspond to R, D, P, F, Φ.
2. Check whether the external system violates the GRE invariants.
3. Assess the scale of discrepancy and the possibility of compensation.

## Section 6. Signatures

This document was created in an open dialogue.  
We confirm that each provision was derived, challenged, and refined during our collaborative work.
